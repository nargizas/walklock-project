# WalkLock

It is an innovative project comprising an app and a physical box utilizing an Arduino microcontroller with a servo and HC-06 Bluetooth module. The app enables users to securely store valuables inside the box and set deadlines and step goals. Once the step goal is achieved within the given time frame, users regain access to their belongings, whether it's money, snacks, or other valuable items. Additionally, a collaborative mode allows users to join rooms with friends, engaging in step challenges. The participant who walks the most by the end of the time frame will be eligible to open the box and receive the money. However, if their step count falls below the minimum required amount, they will not be able to open the box and the money will remain in the communal pool for the next round. The second phase of the project is currently a work in progress, focusing on further enhancements and features. 

## The project was based on Health Connect Codelab

The codelab was used to get started writing [Health Connect][health-connect] apps for Android. The codelab repository is only used to set the permissions for the application correctly. The code for "WalkLock" is contained in the "start" module. 

## Setup

You will need:

*   An Android device or emulator running API level 27 or greater
*   The [Health Connect APK][health-connect-apk] installed on the device or emulator
