# WalkLock

The goal of this project is to create a system that enables a group of friends to motivate each other to stay active by depositing money into a communal box, and setting a time and minimum step count goal. The participant who walks the most by the end of the time frame will be eligible to open the box and receive the money. However, if their step count falls below the minimum required amount, they will not be able to open the box and the money will remain in the communal pool for the next round.

## The project was based on Health Connect Codelab

The codelab was used to get started writing [Health Connect][health-connect] apps for Android. The codelab repository is only used to set the permissions for the application correctly. The "finished" module contains the guidelines and the completed version of the app provided in the Health Connect Codelab. The code for "WalkLock" is contained in the "start" module. 

## Setup

You will need:

*   An Android device or emulator running API level 27 or greater
*   The [Health Connect APK][health-connect-apk] installed on the device or emulator
